## Description
After using a SQL database, getting exposure to raw query strings, navigating the Mongo database felt relatively simple. Most of the work for this assignment came from reading and understanding the code. I started off with the HTML pages to see which js files were being used in each one. Then in each js file I'd look for the functions that were being called immediately, upon page load. Following the trail of function calls made understanding the code a lot easier, which in turn made writing the writes easier.
